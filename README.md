[Bistacchi A., Mittempergher S., Martinelli M., Storti F., 2020. On a new robust workflow for the statistical and spatial analysis of fracture data collected with scanlines (or the importance of stationarity), Solid Earth, 11, 2535–2547, 2020, doi: 10.5194/se-11-2535-2020](https://doi.org/10.5194/se-11-2535-2020).

Please cite this paper if you use the code!

To run the app you have two options:
- download the code in `matlab_code` and run `DomStudioFracStat1D.mlapp` in Matlab® (in this case you need the Statistics and Machine Learning and Signal Processing toolboxes).
- download and install the binary for your platform from `binaries` (it will ask to install Matlab® Runtime if you do not have it already).

The algorithms behind DomStudioFracStat1D have also been refactored in [Streamline2Scanline](https://github.com/gecos-lab/Streamline2Scanline), used for the analysis of spacing between lineaments on Mars in [De Toffoli, B., Massironi, M., Mazzarini, F., & Bistacchi, A., 2021. Rheological and mechanical layering of the crust underneath thumbprint terrains in Arcadia Planitia, Mars.
